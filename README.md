# PicturesRecycler

Purpose of this project was to do an app that shows images from https://picsum.photos/ and display them in recyclerView. Planned scope looked more over like this:
- Make a RecyclerView with Gridview,
- Create adapter and use Glide form displaying images,
- Retreive images using Retrofit,
- Get rid of notifyDataChange and implement DiffUtils,
- Redesign what you have done into MVVM architecture (added PictureViewModel, Repository and ApiClient),

What's left:
- Implement dataBinding
- Zooming images in touch
- Add a little spinner while images are loading

# PicturesRecycler

Purpose of this project was to do an app that displays images from https://picsum.photos/ in recyclerView. What is done:
- Make a RecyclerView with Gridview,
- Create adapter and use Glide for displaying images,
- Use Retrofit for communication with API,
- Get rid of notifyDataChange and implement DiffUtils,
- Redesign what you have done into MVVM architecture (added PictureViewModel, Repository and ApiClient),

What's left:
- Implement dataBinding
- Zooming images in touch
- Add a little spinner while images are loading
